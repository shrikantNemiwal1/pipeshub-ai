"""Resolving which nodes may start a grants pass.

A seed must be granted to the user, non-strict, not deleted, inside a partition
the connector gate admits, and not beneath a hidden group. Strictness is the
load-bearing exclusion: a strict node below a gap can never qualify under
reading (b), so seeding one would over-share (AC-18, AC-41).

The gate is computed first and separately, because a grant inside an app the
user cannot reach must not produce a seed at all — that is what AC-36 and
AC-49 assert.
"""

# Apps the user can reach: a user-app relation, or any permission that reaches
# them. Both legs are OPTIONAL — a user whose only route is the relation would
# otherwise be dropped before seeds are considered — and each source is
# collected separately, since combining a bound variable with collect() in one
# WITH is an implicit grouping key that Cypher rejects.
#
# Both legs are scoped by orgId, as D43 requires and the provider does. Without
# it this oracle admits another org's App whenever a shared principal holds a
# grant on it — orgs share group and org nodes — and since the oracle is what
# the gate is judged against, an org-blind oracle would bless an org-blind
# product. SEC-11's fixture is what made the divergence visible.
