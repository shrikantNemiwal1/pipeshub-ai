"""The v3 per-hop rule, pinned across its whole truth table.

`test_rule_equivalence.py` gates `_kh_v2_rule_cypher`. Nothing gated
`_kh_v3_granted_hop` -- which is the rule the shipped global-flatten query
actually evaluates, and which was rewritten to name the inheritance probe once
instead of twice.

That rewrite is precisely the shape decision 77 warns about: the obvious
three-conjunct compaction of this rule is equivalent for every *declared*
`accessRule` and **fails open on an undeclared one**, returning a node the real
rule hides. Scenario coverage cannot catch that -- only a deliberately
corrupted value separates the two forms. So this module enumerates the rule's
inputs directly:

    accessRule in {OPEN, STRICT, RESTRICTED, <absent>, <unrecognised>}
      x  inherits from the parent  in {yes, no}
      x  granted to the user       in {yes, no}

and asserts which of the 20 children the walk admits.

Intended semantics (design doc §3.1, D75):

    OPEN / absent   inheritance OR a direct grant
    STRICT          inheritance OR a direct grant  (strictness is the whole
                    chain being accessible, not this hop)
    RESTRICTED      inheritance AND a direct grant (AC-16)
    unrecognised    nothing -- corruption fails closed
