"""Any rewrite of the per-hop rule must be provably identical to the shipped one.

The shipped rule is three branches keyed on ``accessRule``. On paper it compacts
to three conjuncts that read ``inherits``/``granted`` once each instead of once
per branch::

    ( accessRule = 'OPEN' OR $allowStrict )
    AND ( inherits OR granted )
    AND ( accessRule <> 'RESTRICTED' OR ( inherits AND granted ) )

That form is **rejected**, and this module is the record of why. It agrees for
all three declared values and diverges on a fourth: an unrecognised
``accessRule`` matches no branch of the shipped rule and is hidden, but it
satisfies ``accessRule <> 'RESTRICTED'`` and is *returned* by the compact form.
The model reads an unknown value as RESTRICTED and the traversal hides it
(decision 38); the compact form fails open instead.

No acceptance scenario catches that, because every fixture node carries a
declared value — which is the trap. The sweep below passes for the naive form
too; only a deliberately corrupted node separates them. A rule rewrite gated on
scenario coverage alone would have shipped the leak.

``_COMPACT_RULE`` here is the *corrected* compaction, which closes the fourth
case and is proven equivalent on both engines. It is kept as the sanctioned
target for anyone who does want to compact the rule later.
