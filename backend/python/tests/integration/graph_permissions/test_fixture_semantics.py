"""The fixture encodes what the design doc says it encodes.

Counts alone prove nothing: a graph can hold the right number of nodes and
still get Example 1 backwards. These assertions pin the shapes the traversal
will be judged against, so that a later failure is read as a query bug rather
than sending us back to re-examine the data.

Everything is asserted through `loaded_graph`, which loads into both backends
after the per-module wipe.
