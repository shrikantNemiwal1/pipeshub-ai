"""Smoke checks for the parity harness itself.

These do not test the traversal. They prove the fixtures reach real engines and
report what each backend's ``connect()`` builds, because the traversal's fixture
loader has to work with whatever schema is actually created — in particular
Arango's named-graph edge definitions, which are narrower than this permission
model needs (see docs/knowledge-hub-permission-model.md §4.4).
