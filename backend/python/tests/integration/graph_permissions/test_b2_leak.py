"""App access is not space access.

This is the regression guard for bug B2, the leak that made every Confluence
space visible to every user of the connector. It is the property the whole
model rests on, so it gets its own module.

The spaces in Example 1 *do* inherit from the App — that is what the design doc
says, and it is safe. What keeps them private is the restriction flag: a
restricted node needs inheritance **and** a direct grant, so inheriting from an
App the user can reach is never sufficient on its own.

U holds grants on both spaces. V has Confluence app access and no space
permission anywhere. U must see both spaces; V must see nothing.
