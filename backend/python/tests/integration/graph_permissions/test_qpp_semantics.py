"""The QPP traversal behaves as the design says, on the doc's own example.

Syntax was proved separately; this is about meaning. Example 2 (§3.5) is the
case that separates the two passes: node 3 is a gap, node 6 is granted directly
beneath it, and 7/8 inherit from 6. A top-down walk alone can never reach 6,
which is the entire reason for the grants pass.

# The per-hop rule from the implementation plan, written as boolean algebra
# rather than nested CASE.
#
# Neo4j 5.26 crashes its planner on an EXISTS { } that references two
# QPP-internal variables when that EXISTS sits inside a CASE expression:
#   "FunctionInvocation cannot be cast to LogicalVariable"
#   (Neo.DatabaseError.General.UnknownError)
# Each construct is fine alone — coalesce(), CASE, a two-variable EXISTS — only
# the combination fails, so the rule is expressed as
#   CASE WHEN s THEN a ELSE b END  ==  (s AND a) OR ((NOT s) AND b)
# which is equivalent and plans cleanly.
#
# The three branches are mutually exclusive by construction now that accessRule
# is one field: the old (non-strict, restricted) combination is unrepresentable,
# so the strict guard that used to neutralise it is gone with it. That guard was
# load-bearing and untested — its absence hid AC-19 — which is why the state it
# defended against was removed rather than defended better.
