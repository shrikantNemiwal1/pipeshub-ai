"""Fixtures for the knowledge-hub permission traversal parity harness.

The harness proves one thing: the new traversal returns *identical* results on
Neo4j and ArangoDB for the agreed rules. See
``docs/knowledge-hub-permission-model.md`` (§3.2 rules, §3.6 traversal) and the
P0 cases in ``docs/knowledge-hub-permission-model-test-cases.md``.

Start the throwaway stores, then run:

    docker compose -p kh-perm -f backend/python/tests/integration/graph_permissions/docker-compose.yml up -d
    pytest tests/integration/graph_permissions -m integration --timeout=300

Environment variables are deliberately harness-scoped. The production names
(``NEO4J_URI``, ``ARANGO_URL``, ...) are **not** read: a developer shell
routinely exports them pointing at a real stack, and this suite wipes whatever
it connects to. Override these instead, defaulted to the compose file above:

    KH_PERM_NEO4J_URI        bolt://localhost:7688
    KH_PERM_NEO4J_USERNAME   neo4j
    KH_PERM_NEO4J_PASSWORD   khpermpass
    KH_PERM_NEO4J_DATABASE   neo4j
    KH_PERM_ARANGO_URL       http://localhost:8530
    KH_PERM_ARANGO_USERNAME  root
    KH_PERM_ARANGO_PASSWORD  khpermpass
    KH_PERM_ARANGO_DB        kh_perm_test

``Neo4jProvider.connect()`` reads ``NEO4J_*`` from the process environment, so
the fixture overwrites those from the values above — inside the test process
only, never the caller's shell.

Both stores are wiped on setup rather than teardown, so a run always starts
clean even if a previous run crashed.

**This suite is destructive.** It refuses to run against anything but loopback,
and refuses the conventional ports (7687/7474, 8529) outright, because a
development instance usually lives there and a wipe would take real data with
it. Override only if you know the target is disposable:

    KH_PERM_ALLOW_DEFAULT_PORTS=1
