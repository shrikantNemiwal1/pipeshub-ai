"""The acceptance graph for the permission traversal, described once.

Backend-agnostic on purpose: the same node and edge lists are loaded into Neo4j
and ArangoDB so a case can be asserted to return *identical* results on both.

It is built with raw inserts rather than through the connector write path, so a
shape can be described directly — including ones no connector emits — and loaded
byte-identically into both backends. ``test_write_path.py`` is the counterpart
that drives the real ``DataSourceEntitiesProcessor``; between them the traversal
is proven against both a hand-described graph and a synced one.

Every node carries the fields ArangoDB's collection validators require. Those
run at ``level: strict`` with ``additionalProperties: False``, so a document is
rejected both for missing a required field and for carrying an unknown one —
Neo4j has no equivalent and would accept anything, which is exactly why the
fixture is written to the stricter of the two.

Node ids are readable rather than uuids so a failing assertion names the node
from the design doc, e.g. ``ex1-r4`` is Example 1's restricted page.
