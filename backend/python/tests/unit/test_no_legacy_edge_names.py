"""The pre-rename hierarchy edge name must not come back (decision 74).

`recordRelations` / `RECORD_RELATION` were renamed to `nodeRelations` /
`NODE_RELATION` across the code base. The dangerous part of that rename is that
the old names live inside query *text* — f-strings of Cypher and AQL — where a
stray reappearance raises nothing at import time and nothing at type-check time.
It surfaces only as a query that quietly matches no edges. This test is the
backstop.

`RecordRelations`, the relationship-type enum (PARENT_CHILD, ATTACHMENT, ...),
is deliberately *not* renamed and must keep matching nothing here: every pattern
below is case-sensitive, which is exactly what kept it intact during the sweep.
