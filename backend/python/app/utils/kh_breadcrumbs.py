"""Breadcrumbs for a knowledge hub v2 browse, chosen from flags the query computed.

The trail follows **placement**, not the raw hierarchy (§3.3, decision 5). Each
level is the node its child is listed under, so an inaccessible ancestor is
replaced by where the child actually appears and is never named (NV-28, SEC-01).

The query makes every permission decision. For the start node and each of its
hierarchy ancestors it returns whether the user may open it and its own record
group; for each hierarchy edge between them, whether the child lists under that
parent. This module only walks those flags upward, so the rule keeps one home —
the query builders — and choosing a trail needs no database to test.

       when it is one (first step only, decision 79), otherwise a non-internal
       parent before an internal one, so the drive location beats Shared with
       Me (decision 67), with the id as a stable tiebreak;
