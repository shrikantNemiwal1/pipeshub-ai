"""The opaque paging cursor for the knowledge hub v2 read queries.

**Keyset, not offset.** The earlier cursor stored an absolute offset per
partition and approximated the previous page as ``offset - limit``. That is
wrong whenever rows were merged from several partitions — the earlier page was
not necessarily the previous ``limit`` rows of any one of them — and it cannot
be fixed inside that format. Storing the boundary row's own sort key instead
makes the previous page exact by construction, and makes a page stable when
rows are inserted or deleted mid-walk.

The stored key is **the comparator's own output** (``sortKey`` and
``nullRank``), as the query computed it, plus the row id as the tiebreak. That
is what keeps the query and the in-process merge using one comparator rather
than two implementations that happen to agree today.

**One boundary for every partition.** Every partition sorts on the same
comparator, and a node found in two partitions sits at the same position in
both, so a page's position is a single boundary — its last row going forward,
its first row going back — and each partition resumes from that same point.
A boundary per partition would need a partition that contributed nothing to a
page to carry its old boundary forward, and a previous page from it to include
the boundary row itself: two edges where rows are silently skipped or repeated.
The cursor also says which partitions may still have rows, so a finished one is
not queried again (decision 57's intent) — as a **bitset over the partition
order discovery returns**, plus a fingerprint of that list. Naming them by id
does not fit: a Drive tenant has a top-level group per user, so the id list runs
to tens of kilobytes and a cursor that travels in a URL stops working at exactly
the scale where skipping finished partitions matters. If the fingerprint does
not match — the user gained or lost access mid-walk — the bits are meaningless
and every current partition is queried instead, which the shared boundary keeps
*exact* rather than merely close. The service re-checks partitions against the
user's current access on every page either way (PG-30).

**Every failure is a 400.** A cursor that does not parse, does not verify, or
does not belong to this user is never repaired, clamped, or silently treated as
"first page" — each of those turns a bug or an attack into a plausible-looking
result. Callers translate `CursorError` into an error response and nothing else.
