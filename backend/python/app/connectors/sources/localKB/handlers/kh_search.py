"""One page of a global knowledge hub search, one call per connector.

Step 1 resolves who the user is and buckets every directly granted node by
connector. Each connector is then one query: the children they may see, the
filters, and a single page. Those pages are merged into one ordered page, and
the cursors resume it.

**Access is resolved per page, never carried in the cursor.** The grantees and
the connector list are recomputed on every request, so a grant removed between
two pages takes effect on the next one (PG-29), and a cursor edited to name a
connector the user cannot reach has nothing to name: positions are resolved
against the list *this* request discovered (PG-30). What the cursor carries is
where the page stopped, not what the user may see.

**A failed connector fails the request** (PG-26). A page assembled from the
connectors that happened to answer looks exactly like a complete one — same
shape, same full page, plausible total — and the rows it silently omits are
indistinguishable from rows the user has no access to.
