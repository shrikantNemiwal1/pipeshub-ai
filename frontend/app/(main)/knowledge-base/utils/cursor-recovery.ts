/**
 * Was this failure the API refusing the cursor we sent?
 *
 * A cursor can be refused for reasons the user cannot act on: it was signed
 * with a key that has since rotated, issued to a different user or org, or
 * edited in a URL someone shared. FE-08 requires that such a page returns to
 * the first page rather than stranding the view on an error.
 *
 * Only a 400 qualifies — a rejected cursor is a malformed request, whereas
 * 403/404/5xx are about the node or the server and must still surface. A 400
 * raised by something else (an unknown sort field, say) clears a cursor that
 * was not at fault; the refetch then reports that error with no cursor left to
 * retry, so this cannot loop.
